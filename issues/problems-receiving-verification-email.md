# Problems receiving verification email

We're sorry you're experiencing issues receiving your verification email to verify your account! Below are some common issues for this problem:

### You're a middle school student signing up using your SFUSD email.

Students within the San Francisco Unified School district and are in middle school may experience issues with receiving any emails from us because there is a firewall blocking any external emails from being sent to any students.

{% hint style="info" %}
In this case, our recommendation would be to use a non-SFUSD email to sign up for our platform.
{% endhint %}

### You have a typo in your account email address.

If you realize that you may have a typo in the email you provided during signup, please reach out to our team at [hello@operationstart.org](mailto:hello@operationstart.org) to correct this typo. When reaching out to our team, please send us the wrong email address and the one you'd like us to change it to.

{% hint style="info" %}
This method will only work for users who have a typo in their email, not a completely different email address.
{% endhint %}
