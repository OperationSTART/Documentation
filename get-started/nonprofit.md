# Get started as a nonprofit

OperationSTART is a powerful platform for students and school staff to discover enrichment opportunities and for nonprofits to get the word out about the enrichment opportunities they offer. \
\
As a nonprofit organization, you can add your organization to OperationSTART and then create enrichment opportunities affiliated with your organization. Once we approve the opportunity, both students and school staff will be able to view it!\
\
We have many features planned in our roadmap for the future to make OperationSTART an even more powerful tool to outreach and recruit for your organization and its specific programs!\
\
