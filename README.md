# Introduction to Help Desk

The OperationSTART Help Desk is where the team creates and edits documentation to better our user's experience on the platform. This is all powered by Gitbook. If you need assistance and cannot find any answers on this documentation, email [hello@operationstart.org](mailto:hello@operationstart.org).

This documentation is organized in a particular way designed for the best experience.

1. **Getting Started** is a place for the new users to OperationSTART to jumpstart their journey. This section has documentation for **signing up for an account** as a user and nonprofit organization**.**
2. **Resources** is a place where you can find resources or references for specific terms used in our platform. We'll have "?" icons where common questions come up. _\(This section is coming soon\)_
3. **Common Issues** is where you can find the frequent issues that users may experience and resolutions to these issues. If you cannot find an answer to the issue you're experiencing, please reach out to us at [hello@operationstart.org](mailto:hello@operationstart.org).
