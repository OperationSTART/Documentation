# Introduction to Help Desk

The OperationSTART Help Desk is a place where the team creates and edits documentation to better our user's experience on the platform. This is all powered by Gitbook. If you need assistance and cannot find any answers on this documentation, send an email to [hello@operationstart.org](mailto:hello@operationstart.org).

This documentation is organized in a particular way designed for the best experience.

1. **Getting Started** is a place for the new users to OperationSTART to jumpstart their journey. This section has documentation for **signing up for an account.**
